#### Project Title:
GitHub → Docker Hub → External Server CI/CD Pipeline

### 1️⃣ Development Environment
Tool: Replit
Purpose: Development and testing of the application before pushing to GitHub.

Steps:
- Develop and test code on Replit workspace.
- Use `git push` to push latest code to GitHub repository.

### 2️⃣ Source Control Details
GitHub Information:
GITHUB_USERNAME = vishaal314
GITHUB_REPO     = myapp

Repository Usage:
- All code pushed to the `main` branch triggers a GitHub Action.
- The Action will build and publish the Docker image automatically.

### 3️⃣ Container Registry Details
Docker Hub Information:
DOCKERHUB_USERNAME = vishaalnoord7
DOCKERHUB_TOKEN    = dckr_pat_Y4tYx9kjQy5k4MA-WMDQ6Rka3K8

Expected Image Name Format:
vishaalnoord7/myapp:latest

GitHub Action Task:
- Login to Docker Hub using provided credentials.
- Build the Docker image using the repository’s `Dockerfile`.
- Push the image to Docker Hub tagged as `latest`.

### 4️⃣ Deployment Server Information
External Server Details:
SSH_HOST         = 45.81.35.202
SSH_USER         = root
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY  = 9q54IQq0S4l3
APP_DIR          = /opt/dataguardian

Expected Behavior:
- On manual approval in the GitHub Action:
  - SSH into external server.
  - Pull the latest Docker image from Docker Hub.
  - Stop and remove any old container named `myapp`.
  - Run the new container using:
    docker run -d --name myapp -p 80:80 -v /opt/dataguardian:/data vishaalnoord7/myapp:latest
  - Ensure container starts successfully.

### 5️⃣ GitHub Action Pipeline Flow
Trigger: On push to `main` branch
Jobs:
1. Build Job
   - Checkout code from GitHub
   - Build Docker image
   - Push to Docker Hub
2. Deploy Job
   - Waits for manual approval
   - SSH into external server
   - Pull latest Docker image
   - Stop existing container (if any)
   - Run new container

Workflow File Path: .github/workflows/deploy.yml

### 6️⃣ Replit Integration Notes
- Add your GitHub repo to Replit as a connected project.
- Use `git push origin main` to trigger deployment.
- Optional: Add `.env` file in Replit to store sensitive info locally.

### ✅ Example of Final Flow
1. You develop in Replit.
2. You push changes to GitHub (main branch).
3. GitHub Actions automatically:
   - Builds and pushes Docker image to Docker Hub.
4. You approve manual deployment step in GitHub.
5. Action connects to 45.81.35.202, updates container.
6. New app version becomes live at your server IP.
