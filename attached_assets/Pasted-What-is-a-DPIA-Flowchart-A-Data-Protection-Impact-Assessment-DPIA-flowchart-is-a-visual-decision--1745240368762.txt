What is a DPIA Flowchart?
A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) flowchart is a visual decision-making guide used to determine:

When a DPIA is required, based on the nature of data processing.

How to carry out the assessment, including key steps.

What actions to take based on the DPIA results.

It helps ensure organizations comply with privacy laws (like the GDPR) when processing personal data, especially when there's a high risk to individual rights or freedoms.

🧭 DPIA Flowchart – Key Stages
Here's what a standard DPIA flowchart might look like (simplified):

Are you processing personal data?

❌ No → DPIA not required.

✅ Yes → Next step.

Is the processing likely to result in a high risk to rights and freedoms of individuals?

✅ Yes → DPIA required.

❓ Not sure → Do a screening or consult DPO.

❌ No → DPIA may not be needed.

Common high-risk triggers:

Large-scale profiling

Monitoring public areas (e.g., CCTV)

Using new technologies

Biometric or genetic data

Systematic surveillance

If DPIA is needed:

Describe the data processing

Assess necessity and proportionality

Identify and assess risks

Identify measures to mitigate risks

Outcome:

Risk is acceptable → Proceed with safeguards

High risk with no mitigation → Consult supervisory authority
