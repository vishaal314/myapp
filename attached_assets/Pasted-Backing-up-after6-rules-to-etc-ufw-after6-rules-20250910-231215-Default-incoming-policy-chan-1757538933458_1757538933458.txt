Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Requesting a certificate for dataguardianpro.nl

Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/dataguardianpro.nl/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/dataguardianpro.nl/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2025-12-09.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
NEXT STEPS:
- The certificate will need to be renewed before it expires. Certbot can automatically renew the certificate in the background, but you may need to take steps to enable that functionality. See https://certbot.org/renewal-setup for instructions.
