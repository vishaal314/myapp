3.1 GDPR code-scanner/
Stack: Python + TruffleHog / Semgrep + Presidio + Regex/NLP
Requirements:

Multi-language support: Python, JS, Java, Terraform, YAML, etc.
Secrets detection via entropy, regex, and known providers (AWS, Azure, Stripe, etc.)
Custom rule support (e.g., semgrep-rules.yaml or presidio recognizers)
Metadata enrichment: Git blame, commit hash, author
Regional PII tagging (UAVG, BDSG, CNIL, GDPR Article ref.)
False positive suppression (baseline diffing or ignore rules)
CI/CD compatibility (CLI + JSON output)
Output Format:

{
  "file": "src/auth.py",
  "line": 72,
  "type": "API_KEY",
  "entropy": 4.9,
  "region_flags": ["GDPR-Article5", "UAVG"],
  "context_snippet": "api_key = 'sk_test_****'",
  "commit_info": {
    "author": "vishaal.kumar",
    "commit_id": "a8b91a3"
  }
} 

OUTPUT : reports : pdf ,html 

2. Core GDPR Principles (Implementation Guidelines)
- **Lawfulness, Fairness, Transparency**: All scans must log metadata of processing.
- **Purpose Limitation**: Flag data used outside defined scope.
- **Data Minimization**: Highlight unused or excessive data.
- **Accuracy**: Validate if detected data is recent and correct.
- **Storage Limitation**: Detect outdated or stale PII.
- **Integrity & Confidentiality**: Secure data in transit and at rest.
- **Accountability**: Generate audit logs and traceable report links.
