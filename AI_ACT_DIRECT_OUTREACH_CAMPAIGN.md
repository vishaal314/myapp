Email 1 (Day 1):
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company Name] is using AI for [specific use case]. With the EU AI Act enforcement starting August 2025, I'm concerned about potential compliance gaps.

Quick question: Have you classified your AI systems as High-Risk, Limited Risk, or Minimal Risk under the new regulation?

If you haven't started this process, you're facing a €35M fine risk. I'd like to show you how [similar company] achieved compliance in 30 days.

Worth a 15-minute call this week?

Best,
[Name]
DataGuardian Pro

```
Email 2 (Day 4 - No Response):
Subject: "AI Act Compliance Checklist - [Company Name]"

Hi [Name],

I sent a note about AI Act compliance earlier this week. Here's a quick self-assessment:

AI Act Compliance Checklist:
□ AI systems risk classification completed
□ Documentation for high-risk systems
□ Human oversight protocols established
□ Continuous monitoring implemented
□ Dutch DPA reporting procedures

If you checked fewer than 3 boxes, we should talk.

[Similar company] was in the same position 30 days ago. Now they're fully compliant.

15-minute call available Thursday or Friday?

Best,
[Name]
```

```
Email 3 (Day 8 - No Response):

Hi [Name],

Latest from the Dutch DPA on AI Act enforcement:

"Companies using AI for [specific use case] are considered high-risk and must have compliance documentation ready by August 2025."

This directly impacts [Company Name]'s [specific AI system].

I'm attaching a case study of how [similar company] avoided this risk in 30 days.

Would you like to see how this applies to your situation?

[Schedule 15-minute call]

Best,

Hi [Name],

Noticed [Company Name] has been growing fast with AI-powered [specific use case]. 

Quick question: How much are you budgeting for AI Act compliance?

Most companies I talk to are quoted €50K-€100K for manual assessments.

As a Dutch company using AI for [specific use case], you're dealing with both EU AI Act AND Netherlands-specific requirements.
