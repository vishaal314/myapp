41.27 INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of textract to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
42.02 ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 63) and beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.
42.02
42.02 The conflict is caused by:
42.02     The user requested beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0
42.02     textract 1.6.5 depends on beautifulsoup4~=4.8.0
42.02
42.02 To fix this you could try to:
42.02 1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
42.02 2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
