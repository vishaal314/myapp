### Template 1: SME Growth Companies
**Subject:** Your privacy compliance costs could be 70% lower

Hi [Name],

Most Dutch companies are overpaying for privacy compliance tools that create more work, not less.

OneTrust charges €827-€2,275/month for basic scanners with 30-50% false positives. That means your team spends hours investigating fake alerts.

**DataGuardian Pro delivers:**
- 10 AI-powered scanners (vs OneTrust's 3-5)
- 95% accuracy (no more false alarms)  
- €49.99-€999.99/month (70-80% savings)
- Complete Netherlands UAVG compliance
- BSN validation built-in

**Real ROI:** Companies save €50K+ annually while getting better coverage.

Ready for a 15-minute demo showing exactly how much you could save?

Best regards,
[Your name]

P.S. We're the only platform with EU AI Act 2025 compliance built-in. €35M fines start soon.

### Template 2: AI Companies
**Subject:** EU AI Act 2025: €35M fines start January. Are you ready?

Hi [Name],

The EU AI Act enforcement begins January 2025 with fines up to €35M or 7% of annual turnover.

Most AI companies aren't prepared because existing privacy tools don't cover AI-specific requirements.

**DataGuardian Pro is the world's first AI Act compliance scanner:**
- Automatic risk classification (High-Risk, Limited Risk, Minimal Risk)
- Article-specific compliance checks (Articles 9, 10, 11, 14, 43, 50)
- Netherlands implementation requirements
- Multi-framework support (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX)

**Companies using our AI scanner protect €50-200K monthly revenue** by staying compliant.

Can we show you a 20-minute demo of AI Act compliance automation?

Best regards,
[Your name]

P.S. We also handle your regular GDPR/UAVG compliance with 9 additional scanners.
