Create: services/enterprise_connector_scanner.py

Why a New Scanner is Best:
Distinct Purpose: Enterprise data connectors are fundamentally different from existing scanner types
Complex Authentication: OAuth2, API tokens, service accounts per platform
Data Source Variety: APIs, file systems, databases, SaaS platforms
Connection Management: Persistent connections, rate limiting, retry logic
Netherlands Specialization: Exact Online, Dutch banking systems
Architecture Design:
class EnterpriseConnectorScanner:
    """
    Scanner for enterprise data source integrations:
    - Microsoft 365 (SharePoint, OneDrive, Exchange)
    - Exact Online (Dutch ERP)
    - Google Workspace (Drive, Gmail)
    - Dutch Banking APIs
    """
    
    def __init__(self, connector_type: str, credentials: Dict):
        self.connector_type = connector_type  # 'microsoft365', 'exact_online', 'google_workspace'
        self.credentials = credentials
        self.pii_detector = PiiDetector()
    
    def scan_connector(self, config: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Main scanning method for enterprise connectors"""
        pass
    
    def _authenticate_microsoft365(self) -> bool:
        """OAuth2 authentication for Microsoft Graph API"""
        pass
    
    def _scan_sharepoint_sites(self) -> List[Dict]:
        """Scan SharePoint document libraries"""
        pass
    
    def _authenticate_exact_online(self) -> bool:
        """Exact Online API authentication"""
        pass
    
    def _scan_exact_customers(self) -> List[Dict]:
        """Scan Exact Online customer data"""
        pass
Implementation Priority:
Microsoft 365 Connector (85% market penetration)

SharePoint document libraries
OneDrive personal files
Exchange email scanning
Teams chat history
Exact Online Connector (60% Netherlands SME)

Customer records (BSN detection)
Employee data
Invoice/financial data
Project documents
Google Workspace Connector (40% modern businesses)

Google Drive files
Gmail content
Google Docs/Sheets
Chat messages
Integration with Existing System:
Uses Existing PII Detection: Leverages utils/pii_detection.py with Netherlands patterns
Uses Existing Reporting: Integrates with current report generators
Uses Existing Auth: Leverages services/auth.py for user authentication
Uses Existing License: Integrates with services/license_integration.py
Benefits of New Scanner:
✅ Clean Architecture - Separation of concerns from existing scanners
✅ Focused Development - Dedicated team can work on connectors without breaking existing functionality
✅ Easy Testing - Independent testing of connector functionality
✅ Scalable Design - Easy to add new enterprise connectors
✅ Netherlands Focus - Built specifically for Dutch market requirements

Bottom Line:
Create a new enterprise_connector_scanner.py that specializes in enterprise data source integrations. This keeps the existing scanners focused on their current purposes while adding the critical connectivity needed for market launch.

The new scanner will be the 11th scanner type in DataGuardian Pro, specifically designed to address the enterprise connectivity gap that's blocking €25K MRR achievement in the Netherlands market.
