Recent logs:
8:C 01 Oct 2025 20:21:32.973 # WARNING Memory overcommit must be enabled! Without it, a background save or replication may fail under low memory condition. Being disabled, it can also cause failures without low memory condition, see https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/issues/1328. To fix this issue add 'vm.overcommit_memory = 1' to /etc/sysctl.conf and then reboot or run the command 'sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1' for this to take effect.

⚠️  STILL NEEDS ATTENTION
========================

The app.py imports work in Python, but Streamlit
isn't executing the main logic. This is unusual.

Possible causes:
1. Streamlit session state issue
2. Early exit condition in app.py
3. Need to access via browser (WebSocket connection)
