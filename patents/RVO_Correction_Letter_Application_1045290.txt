Dear Sir/Madam,

In response to your letter regarding vormgebreken (formal deficiencies) in patent application NL2025003 (Application #1045290), I hereby submit the corrected documents to address the identified issues.

Summary of Corrections:

1. Regelnummering (Line Numbering): Added line numbers every 5 lines (5, 10, 15, 20, etc.) to the Description (Beschrijving), Conclusions (Conclusies), and Drawings (Tekeningen) sections, with 5-space padding for non-numbered lines.

2. Paginanummering (Page Numbering): Verified and corrected sequential page numbering in "PAGINA X van Y" format across all sections:
   - Description: PAGINA 1-8 van 8
   - Conclusions: PAGINA 9-12 van 12
   - Drawings: PAGINA 13-16 van 16
   - Extract: No page numbering (per RVO.nl requirements)

3. Format Consistency: Ensured all documents match the required RVO.nl format with proper spacing, clean professional text, and bilingual content (Dutch/English).

4. Technical Accuracy: Maintained all technical claims and implementation details with verified accuracy against the actual codebase.

The corrected documents are submitted as plain text (.txt) files as required, containing:
- Beschrijving (Description) with line numbering
- Conclusies (Conclusions) with line numbering
- Tekeningen (Drawings) with line numbering
- Uittreksel (Abstract, max 250 words) without line numbering

I kindly request confirmation of receipt and acknowledgment that the submitted documents resolve the identified vormgebreken.
