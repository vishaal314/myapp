✅ What is a DPIA?
A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is a process required under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to identify and minimize data protection risks in data processing activities—particularly those likely to result in high risk to individuals’ rights and freedoms.

🔗 DPIA & GDPR: Legal Relevance
Under Article 35 of the GDPR, a DPIA is mandatory when data processing:

Involves systematic and extensive profiling

Involves large-scale processing of special categories (e.g., health data)

Includes monitoring of publicly accessible areas

Failing to conduct a required DPIA can lead to administrative fines of up to €10 million or 2% of annual global turnover.

📊 DPIA Workflow (Step-by-Step)
Step 1: Identify the Need for a DPIA
Is the data processing new or significantly changed?

Could it impact the rights of individuals?

Use a screening checklist or flowchart.

Step 2: Describe the Processing
What is being done with the data?

Why is it being done?

Who is involved (controllers, processors)?

What data is being used?

Step 3: Assess Necessity & Proportionality
Is the processing necessary for your purpose?

Are you minimizing data collected?

Are the methods justified, legal, and fair?

Step 4: Identify and Assess Risks
Risks to data confidentiality, integrity, and availability

Risks to individual rights (e.g., profiling, discrimination)

Use a risk matrix to rate likelihood and severity

Step 5: Identify Mitigation Measures
Technical: encryption, access control, anonymization

Organizational: training, policies, audits

Legal: updating privacy notices, managing consents

Step 6: Sign-Off & Outcomes
Document the decision (proceed, revise, consult authority)

If high risk remains → consult supervisory authority (e.g., ICO)

Retain DPIA as a living document – revisit regularly

Step 7: Integration into Project Plan
Align with project timelines

Assign responsible parties

Include DPIA findings in design documentation

📄 Extensive DPIA Report Template
Here’s a comprehensive DPIA structure you can adapt:

1. Overview

Track website interactions, purchase history, and support chats.

4. Nature of Processing
Data collected: Name, email, device ID, behavior logs

Processing: Automated profiling to determine preferences

Storage: Encrypted cloud storage in EU

Retention: 12 months

5. Legal Basis
Legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f))

Clear opt-out mechanism provided to users

Balancing test conducted

6. Data Flow Mapping
Sources: Web forms, mobile app, internal CRM

Processors: AWS (hosting), Segment (analytics)

Transfers: EU only

7. Risk Assessment

Risk	Likelihood	Impact	Overall Risk	Mitigation
Unauthorized access	Medium	High	High	2FA, role-based access
Profiling bias	Low	High	Medium	Regular audits, training
Data subject unaware	Medium	Medium	Medium	Transparent privacy notice
8. Mitigation Measures
Pseudonymization of analytics data

DPO sign-off before model deployment

Regular DPIA reviews

Data subject rights reinforced (e.g., access, objection)

9. Consultation
DPO consulted: ✅

Supervisory Authority consultation: ❌ Not required

Data subjects consulted: No, not feasible at this stage

10. Final Decision
DPIA completed and reviewed.

Residual risk is low with measures in place.

Approved to proceed.
