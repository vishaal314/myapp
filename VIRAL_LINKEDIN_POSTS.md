### Post 1: Money-Focused Hook 💰
```
🚨 I just saved a Netherlands company €23,700 in GDPR compliance costs.

Here's how:

❌ BEFORE: OneTrust Enterprise - €25,000/year
✅ AFTER: DataGuardian Pro - €300/year  

Same compliance results. 95% cost savings.

The CEO's reaction? "Why didn't we find this sooner?"

Stop overpaying for compliance.

### Post 2: EU AI Act Urgency ⚡
```
🚨 EU AI Act 2025 deadline: 203 days remaining

High-risk AI systems face penalties up to €35M.

Most Netherlands companies don't even know their risk level.

I built an AI Act Calculator that assesses compliance in 5 minutes:

✅ Risk classification  
✅ Penalty exposure
✅ Compliance roadmap
✅ Implementation timeline

Don't wait until it's too late.

### Post 6: Personal Brand Story 👨‍💻
```
3 years ago, I watched a Rotterdam startup shut down due to a €180K GDPR fine.

Their "crime"? Inadequate data protection.

The penalty could have been prevented for €300.

That day, I decided to build DataGuardian Pro.

Mission: Make enterprise-grade compliance accessible to every Netherlands business.

Results so far:
• 500+ companies protected
• €2.3M in fines prevented  
• 95% cost reduction achieved
• Zero compliance failures

We're just getting started.
