CLAIMS

Claim 1
10

An intelligent database scanning system, comprising:

a) a multi-engine database connector module supporting 3 database types: PostgreSQL via psycopg2, MySQL via mysql.connector, Microsoft SQL Server via pyodbc, with unified connection abstraction;

b) a priority-based table selection algorithm with scoring: user/customer/employee tables 3.0×, medical/health/patient 3.0×, payment/billing 2.8×, transaction 2.5×, contact/address/phone/email 2.5×, financial/bank/card 2.8×, credential/password 2.8×, session 2.0×, audit/log 1.5×, system 1.2×, temp 0.8×, test 0.5×;
 15

c) an adaptive sampling strategy module with 3 modes: fast (100 rows/table, 2 workers, ≤15 tables), smart (300 rows/table, 3 workers, ≤50 tables), deep (500 rows/table, 3 workers, ≤75 tables), where strategy selection is based on total_tables, estimated_rows, and risk_level;

d) a parallel scanning engine with connection pooling (3 concurrent workers via ThreadPoolExecutor) reducing scan time 60% (4 hours → 1.6 hours);
 20

e) a Netherlands PII detection module with BSN validation (9-digit + 11-proef checksum: (d₀×9 + d₁×8 + ... + d₇×2 - d₈×1) mod 11 == 0), IBAN NL pattern (NL\d{2}[A-Z]{4}\d{10}), KvK 8-digit numbers, Dutch postal codes (1234AB), Dutch phone numbers (+31/0031/0);

f) a schema intelligence analyzer performing automatic column priority detection (ssn/bsn: 3.0×, passport: 3.0×, email/phone: 2.5×, medical/health/diagnosis: 3.0×, password/token/secret: 2.8×);
 25

whereby the system prioritizes table selection based on priority_score (sorted descending) and calculates scan coverage metrics (tables_scanned / tables_discovered × 100).

Claim 2

The system according to claim 1, wherein the multi-engine database connector:
 35

a) implements PostgreSQL connection:
   ```
   psycopg2.connect(host, port=5432, database, user, password)
   ```
 40

b) implements MySQL connection:
   ```
   mysql.connector.connect(host, port=3306, database, user, password)
   ```
 45

c) implements Microsoft SQL Server connection:
   ```
   pyodbc.connect(f"DRIVER={{ODBC Driver 17}};SERVER={host};...")
   ```
 50

Claim 3

The system according to claim 1, wherein the priority-based table selection algorithm:
 55

a) calculates table priority via:
   ```
   base_score = 1.0
   for keyword in TABLE_PRIORITIES:
 60        if keyword in table_name.lower():
           base_score = max(base_score, TABLE_PRIORITIES[keyword])
   
   column_boost = max(COLUMN_PRIORITIES[col] × 0.3 for col in columns)
   priority_score = min(base_score + column_boost, 3.5)
 65    ```

b) sorts tables by priority_score descending;

c) selects top N tables where N = strategy['target_tables'];
 70

d) categorizes priority distribution (high ≥2.5, medium ≥1.5, low <1.5).

Claim 4

The system according to claim 1, wherein the adaptive sampling strategy module:

a) selects fast mode when total_tables ≤ 15:
 80    sample_size = 100 rows
   workers = 2
   scan_time ≈ 5-10 minutes;

b) selects smart mode when 15 < total_tables ≤ 50:
 85    sample_size = 300 rows
   workers = 3
   scan_time ≈ 20-40 minutes;

c) selects deep mode when total_tables > 50:
 90    sample_size = 500 rows
   workers = 3
   target_tables = 75 maximum
   scan_time ≈ 1-2 hours;

 95 d) automatically adjusts strategy based on database size and detected risk level.

---

Claim 5

100 The system according to claim 1, wherein the parallel scanning engine:

a) creates connection pool with queue management:
   ```
   connection_pool = queue.Queue()
105    for _ in range(workers):
       conn = create_database_connection()
       connection_pool.put(conn)
   ```

110 b) executes concurrent table scans via ThreadPoolExecutor:
   ```
   with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
       futures = {executor.submit(scan_table, t): t for t in tables}
   ```
115

c) achieves 60% time reduction: 4 hours → 1.6 hours;

d) implements connection reuse to minimize database connection overhead.

Claim 6

The system according to claim 1, wherein Netherlands PII detection:
125

a) validates BSN with official 11-proef checksum:
   ```
   checksum = 0
   for i in range(8):
130        checksum += int(bsn[i]) * (9 - i)
   checksum -= int(bsn[8])
   
   valid = (checksum % 11 == 0)
   ```
135

b) detects IBAN NL banking format: NL\d{2}[A-Z]{4}\d{10};

c) identifies KvK numbers: 8-digit pattern validation;

140 d) recognizes Dutch postal codes: \d{4}\s?[A-Z]{2};

e) detects Dutch phone numbers: (\+31|0031|0)\d{9}.

Claim 7

The system according to claim 1, wherein the schema intelligence analyzer:

a) assigns column priorities based on keywords:
150    ssn/bsn/passport → 3.0× (highest)

   password/token/secret → 2.8× (security critical)
   email/phone/bank → 2.5×
   address/birth/dob → 2.2-2.5×;
155

b) calculates column boost as 30% of highest column priority;

c) caps final priority score at 3.5 to prevent over-prioritization;
