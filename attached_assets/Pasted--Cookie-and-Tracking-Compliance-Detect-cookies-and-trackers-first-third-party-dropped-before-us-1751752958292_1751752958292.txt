 Cookie and Tracking Compliance
🔍 Detect cookies and trackers (first/third-party) dropped before user consent.

✅ Check for Cookie Consent Banners:

Are they shown on first load?

Do they block non-essential cookies until consent? (prior consent requirement).

Are users allowed to:

Reject all cookies as easily as accepting them? (“equally easy” buttons rule, enforced heavily in NL).

Granularly choose categories (functional, analytics, marketing)?

Does consent persist for a reasonable time?

Is consent logged and revocable? (“withdraw consent as easily as given”).

🏷 Detect dark patterns:

Pre-ticked boxes (forbidden).

Nudging users to accept.

2️⃣ Privacy Policy & Legal Disclosures
📜 Verify the existence and accessibility of a Privacy Policy:

Clear and understandable language (Art. 12 GDPR).

States legal basis for processing (Art. 6).

Lists user rights (access, rectification, deletion, portability).

Contact details of Data Controller and DPO (if applicable).

🗂 Check Imprint / Legal Disclosure (NL: colofon):

Presence of business details (name, address, CoC registration).

3️⃣ Data Collection Practices
📥 Detect forms requesting personal data:

Is explicit consent collected for optional fields?

Are fields minimized (no excessive data)?

Is data transmission secure (HTTPS)?

Are there third-party integrations (e.g., reCAPTCHA, embedded social media widgets) transferring personal data?

4️⃣ Data Transfers
🌍 Scan for external requests to non-EU/EEA domains:

Is there adequate protection for third-country transfers (Art. 44–50 GDPR)?

Are services like Google Analytics used in a compliant way? (NL DPA has fined non-compliant use of GA).

📊 Reporting Requirements
The scanner should produce:

HTML Reports:

✅ Compliant vs ❌ Non-Compliant Sections.

Visual heatmaps showing tracking scripts and cookie activity.

List of all third-party domains contacted.

Summary: High, Medium, Low risk issues.

Export Options: PDF, CSV for legal teams.

Risk Score: Quantitative “GDPR Risk Score” for easy comparison.

⚙️ Non-Functional Requirements
🛡 Security: Must not send sensitive page content to external servers (client-side scanning preferred).

🕵️‍♂️ Stealth Mode: Detect behavior as an ordinary user, with and without consent.

🌐 Multilingual Support: Especially Dutch + English.

🔁 Scheduled Scans: For ongoing compliance monitoring.

🇳🇱 Dutch-Specific Considerations
The Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens (AP) is strict about:

Prior consent for tracking cookies (analytics cookies are considered tracking unless anonymized).

Explicit opt-in for newsletters; no pre-checked boxes.

“Reject All” button required alongside “Accept All” (since 2022 rulings).
